              ELECTRONIC DICTIONARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GROUP
                     GENERAL DICTIONARY LICENCE STATEMENT
 .
 1. Introduction
 .
 In March 2000, James William Breen assigned ownership of the copyright of the
 dictionary files assembled, coordinated and edited by him to the The
 Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group, then at Monash
 University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that the Group will
 foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize all monies
 received for use of the files for the further development of the files, and
 for research into computer lexicography and electronic dictionaries.
 .
 This document outlines the licence arrangement put in place by The Group for
 usage of the files. It replaces all previous copyright and licence statements
 applying to the files.
 .
 2. Application
 .
 This licence statement and copyright notice applies to the following
 dictionary files, the associated documentation files, and any data files which
 are derived from them.
 .
  * JMDICT - Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary File - the Japanese and English
    components (the German, French and Russian translational equivalents are
     covered by separate copyright held by the compilers of that material.)
  * EDICT - Japanese-English Electronic DICTionary File
  * ENAMDICT - Japanese Names File
  * COMPDIC - Japanese-English Computing and Telecommunications Terminology
    File
  * KANJIDIC2 - File of Information about the Kanji in JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212
    and JIS X 0213 in XML format.
  * KANJIDIC - File of Information about the 6,355 Kanji in the JIS X 0208
    Standard (special conditions apply)
  * KANJD212 - File of Information about the 5,801 Supplementary Kanji in the
    JIS X 0212 Standard
  * EDICT-R - romanized version of the EDICT file. (NB: this file has been
    withdrawn from circulation, and all sites carrying it are requested to
    remove their copies.)
  * RADKFILE/KRADFILE - files relating to the decomposition of the 6,355 kanji
    in JIS X 0208 into their visible components.
 .
 Copyright over the documents covered by this statement is held by James
 William BREEN and The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group.
 .
 3. Licence Conditions
 .
 The dictionary files are made available under a Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike Licence (V3.0). The Licence Deed can be viewed here[1],
 and the full Licence Code is here[2].
 .
 In summary (extract from the Licence Deed):
 | You are free:
 |  * to Share - to copy, distribute and transmit the work
 |  * to Remix - to adapt the work
 | Under the following conditions:
 |  * Attribution. You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the
 |    author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse
 |    you or your use of the work).
 |  * Share Alike. If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may
 |    distribute the resulting work only under the same, similar or a
 |    compatible licence.
 For attribution of these files, you must:
  a. in the case of publishing significant extracts of the files, or material
     based on significant extracts of the files, e.g. in a published dictionary
     or in vocabulary lists, clearly acknowledge that you used the files for
     this purpose;
  b. in the case of a software package or WWW server, etc. which uses the files
     or incorporates data from the files, you must:
      i.   acknowledge the usage and source of the files in the documentation,
           publicity material, WWW site of the package/server, etc.;
      ii.  provide copies of the documentation and licence files (in the case
           of software packages). Where the application packaging does not
           provide for the inclusion of such files (e.g. with iPhone
           applications), it is sufficient to provide links, as per the next
           point;
      iii. provide links to either local copies of the documentation and
           licence files or to the locations of the files at Monash University
           or at the EDRDG site.
           If a WWW server is providing a dictionary function or an on-screen
           display of words from the files, the acknowledgement must be made on
           each screen display, e.g. in the form of a message at the foot of
           the screen or page. If, however, material from the files is mixed
           with information from other sources, it is sufficient to provide a
           general acknowledgement of the sources as described above.
           For the EDICT, JMdict and KANJIDIC files, the following URLs may be
           used or quoted:
            * http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html
            * http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict.html
            * http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic.html
 .
 See this page[3] for samples of possible acknowledgement text.
 .
 Note that in all cases, the addition of material to the files or to extracts
 from the files does not remove or in any way diminish the Group's copyright
 over the files.
 .
 Note also that provided the conditions above are met, there is NO restriction
 placed on commercial use of the files. The files can be bundled with software
 and sold for whatever the developer wants to charge. Software using these
 files does not have to be under any form of open-source licence.
 .
 Where use of the files results in a financial return to the user, it is
 suggested that the user make a donation to the Group to assist with the
 continued development of the files. There are several ways of donating:
  * send a cheque (check) in any currency made out to "Monash University".
    The address to use is:

 this licence.

 4. Warranty and Liability

 made available without any warranty whatsoever as to their accuracy or
 suitability for a particular application.

     agree not to hold the Group liable for any actions or events resulting
     from use of the files.

     party on the basis of the use of the files, or any information included

 .
 5. Copyright
 .
 Every effort has been made in the compilation of these files to ensure that
 the copyright of other compilers of dictionaries and lexicographic material
 has not been infringed. The Group asserts its intention to rectify immediately
 any breach of copyright brought to its attention.
 .
 Any individual or organization in possession of copies of the files, upon
 becoming aware that a possible copyright infringement may be present in the
 files, must undertake to contact the Group immediately with details of the
 possible infringement.
 .
